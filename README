1. Introduction to SPSA
========================

Please see the following document (by James C. Spall) as an introduction to SPSA.
http://www.jhuapl.edu/spsa/PDF-SPSA/Spall_Implementation_of_the_Simultaneous.PDF

Unless otherwise stated, we follow the naming conventions and recommendations of the article. 

2. Modifications for chess engine testing
=========================================

Please see matlab pseudocode by Spall (document, p. 821) as a starting point.

For chess engine testing the following lines in the pseudocode

yplus  = loss(thetaplus)
yminus = loss(thetaminus)
ghat = (yplus - yminus) / (2 * ck * delta)

are replaced with:

ghat = match(thetaplus, thetaminus) / (ck * delta)

match() plays a game between two identical engines.
If engine 1 (= thetaplus) wins, it returns 1.
If engine 2 (= thetaminus) wins, it returns -1.
If game is drawn, it returns 0.

For engine testing it makes sense to define a new varible "relative apply factor" Rk:
Rk := ak / ck^2.

It's interpretation is following:

theta := theta + ak * ghat
<=>
theta := theta + ak * match(thetaplus, thetaminus) / (ck * delta)
<=>
theta := theta + Rk * ck * match(thetaplus, thetaminus) / delta

Instead of trying to find ideal values for ak, we can try to find an ideal value for Rk.

3. Configuration file
=====================

To execute script 'spsa.pl', you need an INI style configuration file.
Take a look at example files provided. All options should be self-explanatory.

4. Variables CSV-file
=====================

Variables file (name of the file is defined in configuration file) is a comma separated (CSV) file.
Columns are defined as follows:

Column 0: Variable name (alphanumeric string)
Column 1: Variable initial value (float)
Column 2: Variable maximum value (float)
Column 3: Variable minimum value (float)
Column 4: Perturbation "ck" for the last iteration (float)
Column 5: Relative apply factor "Rk" for the last iteration (float)
Column 6: For simulation mode, this defines the ELO decrease for point x = (+/-) 100 compared to point x = 0 (optimum) (float).

Notes: 
- When ck is defined for the last iteration and the number of iterations is known, it's easy to derive a value for c.
- When ck and Rk are defined for the last iterations, it's easy to derive ak for the last iteration. Based on that we can derive value for a.

5. Getting Started
==================

- Install Debian/Ubuntu Linux on your computer.
- Install the following packages: libconfig-tiny-perl libtext-csv-perl libmath-round-perl
- Modify stockfish to make parameters available via UCI. Copy the modified stockfish in the same directory with the script.
- Create a config file (just modify 'aggr.conf' slightly) and variable file (just modify 'aggr.var' and add more lines)
- Kick tuning off the tuning, by executing: spsa.pl [configFile]

6. Practical Guidelines
=======================

To be able to successfully use SPSA for tuning, one needs to determine good values for coefficients ck and Rk.
In most cases, it's impossible to determine ideal values. 
For evaluation related parameters, we've had success with the following values:
Rk for the last iteration (CSV-file, column 5): 0.002
ck for the last iteration (CSV-file, column 4): 4 centipawns (= 8 in Stockfish's internal scale)

However if parameter is very unsensitive ELO-wise, one needs to use a larger value for ck.
Also if one has even some sort of idea about the ELO-sensitivity of the parameter and how far from optimum
it might at maximum be, one can use the built-in simulator, to find good values for Rk and ck.
See files 'simul_1var.conf' and 'simul_1var.var' as an example.
